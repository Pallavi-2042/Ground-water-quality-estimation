💧 Ground Water Quality Estimation using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the **potability** of groundwater using key chemical indicators such as pH, conductivity, BOD, and nitrate levels. It helps in identifying whether a water sample is **safe (potable)** or **unsafe (non-potable)** for human consumption.

📌 Problem Statement

Access to clean and safe drinking water is a basic human necessity. Traditional methods for testing water quality are often manual, time-consuming, and expensive. This project uses a data-driven approach to estimate water potability and support better water management and public health monitoring.

🚀 Features

- Preprocessing of real-world groundwater quality dataset
- Classification model to predict potability (0 = Not Safe, 1 = Safe)
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Real-time prediction function to classify new water samples
- Model saved using `pickle` for deployment

🧪 Parameters Used

- **pH** – Level of acidity or alkalinity
- **Conductivity** – Measure of ionic content
- **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)** – Organic pollution indicator
- **Nitrate** – High levels indicate contamination
